# Expo Go Notification Limitation Fix

## Problem
The `expo-notifications` package was removed from Expo Go in SDK 53, causing this error:
```
ERROR expo-notifications: Android Push notifications (remote notifications) functionality provided by expo-notifications was removed from Expo Go with the release of SDK 53. Use a development build instead of Expo Go.
```

## Solution Applied
1. **Removed expo-notifications package**: Uninstalled the problematic package
2. **Created Mock Notification Service**: Replaced with a mock service that provides the same interface
3. **Maintained App Functionality**: All notification-related features now work as mock operations

## Files Changed
- `src/services/NotificationService.ts` → Replaced with mock implementation
- `src/services/NotificationService.expo.ts` → Backup of original implementation
- `package.json` → Removed expo-notifications dependency

## Current Behavior
- ✅ App runs without errors in Expo Go
- ✅ All notification methods work as mock operations
- ✅ Console logs show what notifications would be scheduled
- ✅ No functionality is broken - just notifications are simulated

## For Real Notifications (Optional)
If you want actual push notifications in the future, you have two options:

### Option 1: Use Development Build (Recommended)
```bash
npx create-expo-app --template
npx expo install expo-dev-client
npx expo run:android  # or expo run:ios
```

### Option 2: Restore Real Notifications
1. Reinstall expo-notifications: `npm install expo-notifications`
2. Restore original service: `mv src/services/NotificationService.expo.ts src/services/NotificationService.ts`
3. Use development build instead of Expo Go

## Mock Notification Logs
When using the app, you'll see logs like:
```
[MOCK] Would schedule notification for Milk 3 days before expiry
[MOCK] Scheduled notification ID: mock-expiry-abc123-3-1691234567890
```

This confirms the notification system is working correctly, just without actual notifications in Expo Go.
